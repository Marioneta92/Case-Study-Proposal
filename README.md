## Recommendations

If i were to advise Marcus on their next offerings, it would be the sector of Bitcoin and Blcokchain. Crypto Currency is at an emerging stage and i would bring the case of " why wait?" Tobe proactive and not reactive. I believe that by offering Crypto, this would most likely diversify the firm,s ability to offer a wide range of innovative and evolving products. The use of Various Coding technologies such as Python/Anaconda would be useful to keep up with the evolving techniques tied to Crypto. This technologies needed are industry needed and used, not just for Crypto but also Development of current and future Technologies.
